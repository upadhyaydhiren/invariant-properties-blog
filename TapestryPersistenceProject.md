#Description of Tapestry Persistence Project

# Introduction #

This project contains sample code demonstrating a number of techniques that can be used to support persistence in a tapestry application. N.B., to a large extent the use of tapestry is incidental - I perform some initialization in AppModule but the overwhelming bulk of the code is handled via DI and AOP.
